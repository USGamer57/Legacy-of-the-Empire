It has been three decades since the Great Imperial War, and it is clear that peace is over. In the Europe-like continent (someone can suggest a name), the Empire of Solaria has been revitalized. Though but a small portion of their ancient predecessors, the Great Reclaimer, Vicente Faugno, has claimed that by recreating the empire, glory and prosperity will be granted to their nation and Emperor Romulus the Fifth. 
Meanwhile, Westerland and Laurance are recovering from the loss of their colonies after the Great Imperial War. Some claim the two will never recover from their fall, but the true test will come soon. 
After a period of instability, Stahlrelm has become a free nation, but only time will tell if they can industrialize before Solaria will come to conquer them.
On a small peninsula, a collection of city-states, or rather state-cities, are preparing for war. Divided, either Solaria or Pelem will conquer them, but united, they can expel any invader. Whoever wins will determine which ideology will rule the continent.
To the east of the continent is Pelem, a nation to soon be embroiled in a massive four-way civil war. Though a massive country in size and population, the civil war may leave them vulnerable enough to lose the war.
The northern edge of the continent is the Dwarven Mountains, home of the revolution. Secure the revolution by liberating the continent, or contain it.
On a large island south of the continent is the Remnant Empire, one of the successors of the ancient Solarian Empire. They claim that all the world is theirs, but in their current state, it'll take a miracle to achieve it.

On a large island in the middle of the ocean is the Elven Island, home to three groups of elves that prepare for a war to determine the future of the world. Fight for the Sun Elves to cleanse the world of man, Moon Elves to shut off the world, or the Star Elves to free elvenkind from oppression.

To the north of the Dwarven Mountains is the Northern Wastes, home to the wolfmen, orcs, centaurs, and even civilized expeditions. Unite the Wastes with one of the natives, or colonize it as a human, elf, or dwarf. As a native, you'll have to complete focuses, missions, and decisions in order to catch up with the rest of the world and unlock your true potential.

Across the ocean is the United Federation of Novia, founded by refugees of the Europe-like continent. A mostly human land with considerable minorities of other races, it'll have to overcome centuries of racism to unify its people to save the Old World, or collapse from the strain of a mistreated people.

Everywhere else in the world is free-lore. If there is a place you want to flesh out the lore of, you can do it.
